# LaTeX

to take notes and do problem sets, I use my own style file, more details of which can be found [here](https://github.com/yellowtomato98/_andrew.sty).
* ```notes_template <dir>``` runs a simple script that copies in relevant template files for taking notes. 
* ```pset_template <dir>``` does the same thing, but for files that are useful for writing up solutions to a problem set
