# dotfiles

My collection of dotfiles, for personal use. I use MacOS. 

* [NeoVim](https://neovim.io/) text editor
  * [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for plugins
* [VimTeX](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) to automatically compile my notes as I write them. See [here](latex) for more details on my LaTeX setup.
  * [Zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/) pdf viewer
  * [latexmk](https://mg.readthedocs.io/latexmk.html) for the backend compiler. This comes with most standard LaTeX installations, e.g. [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/)
* [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) shell
* [iterm2](https://iterm2.com/) terminal
